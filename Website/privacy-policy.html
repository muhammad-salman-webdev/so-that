          <p>
            Cookies are small bits of text data placed on your device when you
            visit sites. Cookies record data about your activity, such as which
            pages you view and what you click on. Cookies assist our Platform to
            recognize your device when you return. For example, cookies can help
            us to remember your preferences, username, analyze the performance
            of our Platform and recommend content that may be most relevant to
            your interests.
          </p>
          <p> Here are the reasons we may use cookies: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Analytics. This type of cookies shows us which pages users view,
              which links are popular, etc. These cookies only provide
              anonymized information that does not identify anybody personally.
              This information is then bundled with the similar information from
              the other users, so that we can analyze the general usage
              patterns.

            <li>
              Essential cookies. These are necessary to provide the services
              that you have asked for. Without these essential cookies, our
              Platform would not be able to operate. They are necessary to
              enable users to navigate through the Platform and use its main
              features. E.g., essential cookies identify registered users so
              that they can access member-only areas of the site. Essential
              cookies keep users logged in. If a subscriber disables essential
              cookies, that subscriber won’t be able to get to all of the
              content that a subscription entitles them to. These cookies don't
              collect information that could be utilized for the purposes of
              marketing or figuring out what places on the internet you have
              visited.
            </li>
            <li>
              To improve your browsing experience. This type of cookies enables
              the site to remember users’ preferences and settings, such as
              geographic region or language. They can also be used to restrict
              the number of times an ad is shown, to remember which forms you
              have already filled in, so that you don’t have to do it again.
            </li>
            <li>
              To implement tracking technology on our Platform. This tracking
              does not use your personal information; it uses deidentified data
              (i.e., data that cannot be tied specifically to you). We will not
              combine this data with your other personal information without
              your prior express permission.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            There is a way to turn off cookies by going to your browser’s Help
            or Settings menu. However, keep in mind that disabling cookies may
            limit your use of the Platform and/or delay or affect the way in
            which it operates.

              We will not share your personal information with third parties for
              their direct marketing purposes to the extent it is forbidden by
              law. If our practices change, we will do so in accordance with
              applicable laws and will notify you in advance. California law
              requires that operators of online services disclose how they
              respond to a Do Not Track signal. Some browsers have incorporated
              “Do Not Track” features. Most of these features, when turned on,
              send a signal or preference to the online service that a user
              visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked. At

              obtained about you, where it is stored, for how long, for what
              purposes it is used, to whom it was disclosed. You have the right
              to have us, without undue delay, rectify of inaccurate personal
              data concerning you. That means you can request we change your
              personal data in our records, or have your incomplete personal
              data completed. You have the “right to be forgotten,” i.e. to have

              data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which
              it was collected. However, GDPR gives us the right to refuse
              erasure if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for

              information, if based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the
