              These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) govern your visits to
              <a href="https://kamcpap.com">www.kamcpap.com</a> (the

            </li>
            <li>
              These Terms have a force of a legally binding agreement, even if
              you are simply browsing without intention to contact us or
              register an account. Privacy Policy is another important document
              that you should familiarize yourself with because it describes our
              practices with respect to your personal information. You cannot
              visit the Platform if you do not agree to these Terms or the
              Privacy Policy. Sometimes we modify these Terms. We don’t notify
              users about every change to the Terms but you can see the date of
              the last update at the top of this page. If you still wish to

              Description. The Platform strives to be your one-stop shop for
              top-quality electric toothbrushes, toothpaste, and replacement
              toothbrush heads. Our electric toothbrushes are designed to
              provide a deep clean, remove plaque and promote healthy gums. Our
              toothpaste is formulated to freshen breath, protect against
              cavities, and promote overall oral health. And our replacement
              toothbrush heads are made to the highest standards, ensuring that
              your toothbrush continues to perform at its best for as long as
              possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              Product Use Disclaimer. We would like to advise our customers that
              our electric toothbrush is designed to work with our zero-abrasive
              toothpaste only. The use of regular commercial toothpaste with our
              toothbrush will void the warranty. The use of regular commercial
              toothpastes that contain abrasives such as titanium dioxide,
              aluminum oxide, hydrated silica, Calcium Carbonate, or similar
              abrasives can damage the brush head and motor within seconds.
              Virtually all commercial toothpastes contain such abrasives, and
              it is imperative that you use our zero-abrasive toothpaste, or
              rinse with a fluoride rinse such as ACT before brushing with only
              water.

              Ordering and Payment Information. If you wish to purchase products
              offered on this Platform, you will be asked to provide certain
              information, including payment information. It is your
              responsibility to ensure that all information you provide is
              accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges,
              including taxes, shipping and handling fees, and processing
              charges, incurred in connection with your purchase. Once
              submitted, orders cannot be altered or cancelled. We only accept
              payment from individuals who can purchase with an approved payment
              method. Our products are for personal use only, and we may refuse
              or cancel any order that we suspect is intended for resale. Please
              note that we reserve the right to refuse to process or complete
              any transaction, or to cancel any transaction, at our discretion.
            </li>
            <li>
              Order Limitation Policy. Due to the popularity of some products,
              we may limit the quantities of items that can be purchased. This
              helps us to ensure that as many customers as possible have access
              to our products.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pricing and Availability. All prices and availability of products
              are subject to change without notice. We make every effort to
              provide you with accurate information on pricing and availability,
              however, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mispricing. In the event that a product is listed at an incorrect
              price, we have the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for
              the product at the incorrect price. If an item's correct price is
              lower than the stated price, we will charge the lower amount and
              ship you the item. If an item's correct price is higher than the
              stated price, we will cancel your order and notify you of the
              price error and cancellation. You will then have the option to
              purchase the item at the correct price, if you so choose.

              Product Descriptions. We strive to provide accurate product

              are error-free, complete, reliable, current, or accurate. The

          <h1> 3. SHIPPING POLICY </h1>
          <p>
            Shipping times vary depending on your location, but in most cases,
            orders will be received within 5-7 business days of shipment. We do
            not guarantee specific delivery dates or times. Our shipping and
            handling charges are separate from your purchase price and are
            non-refundable, even in the case of a return. All shipments are FOB
            (Free on Board) Shipping Point, which means that title and risk of
            loss transfers to the customer upon delivery to the carrier. We make
            every effort to ship orders as soon as possible. However, there may
            be delays due to inventory or other unexpected circumstances. In
            such cases, we will notify you of any expected delay and give you
            the option to cancel your order.

          <ol>
            <li>
              Arbitration. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating
              to these Terms, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by
              arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association
              in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and judgment
              on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any
              court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration shall be
              governed by the laws of the State of Idaho. The arbitration will
              be based on the submission of documents and there shall be no
              in-person or oral hearing. Except as may be required by law,
              neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence,
              content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior
              written consent of both parties. You understand that this Section
              means that, by using the Platform, you agree to arbitrate, thus,
              waiving your rights to sue in court and have a jury trial.
            </li>
            <li>
              Class Action Waiver. You acknowledge and agree that you waive your
              right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any
              purported class action or representative proceeding. Further,
              unless both you and us otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator
              may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not
              otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative
              proceeding.

              Communications. You agree that we can communicate with you
              electronically, via SMS, push notifications, email or phone calls.
              All electronic communications shall have the same legal force as
              if they were in paper form.

            <li>
              Relationship of the Parties. You and us are in an independent
              contractor relationship with respect to each other. That means
              that there is no partnership, joint venture, employer/employee or
              any similar arrangement.
            </li>
            <li>
              Force Majeure. We will not be liable for failure to perform any
              obligations to the extent that the failure is caused by a Force
              Majeure event such as, without limitation, act of God, riot, civil
              disturbances, acts of terrorism, fire, explosion, flood, epidemic,
              national mourning, theft of essential equipment, malicious damage,
              strike, lock out, weather, third party injunction, acts or
              regulations of national or local governments.

              Hyperlinks. Linking to our Platform is allowed, however, it must
              always be done in a way that does not adversely affect our
              business or implies some form of association when there is none.
            </li>
            <li>
              Severability. If any part of these Terms is found to be
              unenforceable, then only that particular portion, and not the
              entire Terms, will be unenforceable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Assignment. We have the right, at our sole discretion, to assign
              or subcontract our rights or obligations outlined in these Terms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Waiver. Our failure to exercise any of our rights under these
              Terms shall not be considered a waiver to exercise them in other
              instances. No waiver shall be effective unless it is in writing
              signed by us.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prevailing Language. If there are any inconsistencies or conflicts
              between the English original of these Terms and any foreign
              language translation, the English version shall prevail.
